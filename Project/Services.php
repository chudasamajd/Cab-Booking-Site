Advances in cellular technology have made it far easier, and more cost effective, to use the Internet on the road than it used to be, and there are more ways to get Wi-Fi in your car than ever before. The easiest way to get Wi-Fi in your car is to leverage your existing smartphone as an ad hoc wireless hotspot, but you can also add a mobile data connection and wireless network to any car with a variety of different types of Wi-Fi adapters, have a permanent modem/router combo installed, or even upgrade to a true connected car if doing so fits in your budget.</div>

Offloading the heavy lifting to a dedicated high-res car audio DAC, like you'll find in Sony's pricey RSX-GX9, may be a requirement to actually take advantage of all the high-res music file has to offer, but you can always listen to your uncompressed or lossless-encoded music at a lower sample rate on the road, and then use an external DAC with some high-quality headphones at home.</div>
